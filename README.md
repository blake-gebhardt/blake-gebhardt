-  Hi, I’m @blake-gebhardt, I'm a current Computer Science and International Studies major at Southern Methodist University. I have minors in Russian and History.
-  I’m interested in a lot of things. Currently doing some full-stack development.
-  I’m currently learning front end development, distributed systems, and all the languages that go with those.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I'm still a student so I can't do anything full-time.
-  How to reach me: bgebhardt@smu.edu
